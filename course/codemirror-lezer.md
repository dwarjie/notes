## Topic 1: Introduction to CodeMirror 6

### Essential Concepts
- **Modular Architecture:**  
  CodeMirror 6 is built on a modular system with separate packages for editor state, view, commands, etc.
- **Editor State & View:**  
  Understand the separation between the editor's state (content, selection, etc.) and its view (rendering).
- **Extensions:**  
  Learn how to use pre-built extensions and write your own to add functionality such as syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and custom keybindings.

### Helpful Resources
- [CodeMirror 6 Official Documentation](https://codemirror.net/6/)
- [Introduction to CodeMirror 6 Guides and Examples](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/)

### Assignment/Challenge
- **Task:**  
  Create a simple HTML page that instantiates a CodeMirror 6 editor.
  - Display some static text.
  - Allow basic editing.
- **Tips:**  
  - Start by importing minimal packages such as `@codemirror/state` and `@codemirror/view`.
  - Use a pre-built theme (e.g., basicLight) to get started.
  - Experiment with adding a basic extension like line numbers.

## Topic 2: Deep Dive into CodeMirror 6 State and Extensions

### Essential Concepts
- **State Effects & Transactions:**  
  Learn how CodeMirror 6 handles changes with transactions and state effects.
- **Writing Custom Extensions:**  
  Understand how to create your own extensions to modify editor behavior.
- **View Plugins:**  
  Explore how to extend the editor's view with plugins that interact with DOM events and update the UI dynamically.

### Helpful Resources
- [CodeMirror 6: State & Transactions Documentation](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#state)
- [Example Extensions on GitHub](https://github.com/codemirror)

### Assignment/Challenge
- **Task:**  
  Create a custom extension that logs every change in the editor to the console.
  - **Goal:** Understand how transactions are dispatched and intercepted.
- **Tips:**  
  - Use the `EditorView.updateListener` extension.
  - Experiment with different types of changes (insertion, deletion).

## Topic 3: Introduction to Lezer

### Essential Concepts
- **Lezer Parser System:**  
  Lezer is a parser generator that outputs a parse tree (non-AST) as a JavaScript module.
- **Grammar Definition:**  
  Learn how to write a simple grammar file to parse a basic language (e.g., arithmetic expressions).
- **Parser Output:**  
  Understand the structure of a parse tree and how it can be used for syntax highlighting and basic semantic analysis.

### Helpful Resources
- [Lezer Documentation](https://lezer.codemirror.net/)
- [Example Grammars in Lezer on GitHub](https://github.com/lezer-parser)

### Assignment/Challenge
- **Task:**  
  Write a simple grammar for arithmetic expressions (supporting operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
  - **Goal:** Generate a parser module using Lezer and examine the resulting parse tree.
- **Tips:**  
  - Start with a minimal grammar and use Lezer's online playground (if available).
  - Focus on understanding terminals and non-terminals.

## Topic 4: Integrating Lezer with CodeMirror 6

### Essential Concepts
- **Syntax Highlighting via Lezer:**  
  Learn how to integrate a Lezer parser into a CodeMirror extension to provide custom language support.
- **Semantic Analysis Basics:**  
  Understand how to use the parser’s output for custom highlighting and basic semantic checks.
- **Custom Language Mode:**  
  Create a new language mode for CodeMirror 6 that can support multiple languages.

### Helpful Resources
- [CodeMirror 6 Language Support Guide](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/ref/#language)
- [Using Lezer for Custom Languages Example](https://codemirror.net/6/examples/)

### Assignment/Challenge
- **Task:**  
  Build a simple CodeMirror 6 language extension that uses your Lezer parser from Topic 3.
  - **Goal:** Enable syntax highlighting for a simple arithmetic language.
- **Tips:**  
  - Look at existing language packages in CodeMirror 6 (such as for Python or JavaScript) to understand how the parser is integrated.
  - Experiment with different token styles to visualize your grammar.

## Topic 5: Expanding Your Extension with Multi-Language Support

### Essential Concepts
- **Designing a Multi-Language Framework:**  
  Structure your code so that it can dynamically load and switch between language modules.
- **User Configuration Integration:**  
  Integrate your Chrome extension settings (theme, font size, language selection) with the CodeMirror instance.
- **Dynamic Parser Switching:**  
  Allow the editor to switch between different language modes based on the user's selection.

### Helpful Resources
- [Dynamic Module Import in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import)
- [CodeMirror 6 Dynamic Language Loading Examples](https://codemirror.net/6/examples/)

### Assignment/Challenge
- **Task:**  
  Implement a language selector in your Chrome extension that switches the CodeMirror language mode.
  - **Goal:** Allow users to choose between at least two languages (e.g., Python and your custom arithmetic language).
- **Tips:**  
  - Use dynamic imports to load the appropriate language module.
  - Ensure that switching language modes updates the editor without needing to reload the entire page.

## Final Project: Multi-Language Odoo Better IDE

### Objectives
- Expand your "Odoo Better IDE" extension to support multiple programming languages using CodeMirror 6 and Lezer.
- **Features to Implement:**
  - A user settings interface to select the desired language.
  - Real-time language switching in the CodeMirror instance.
  - Custom syntax highlighting and autocompletion for at least one custom language.

### Challenge
- Integrate all the learned components and ensure smooth syncing with the Odoo editor.
- Test the extension thoroughly to ensure the multi-language support works seamlessly.

## Additional Tips
- **Documentation & Community:**  
  Regularly consult the official CodeMirror and Lezer documentation, and check out community examples on GitHub or forums.
- **Incremental Learning:**  
  Tackle one topic at a time and gradually integrate features into your extension.
- **Experimentation:**  
  Don’t be afraid to experiment with settings and custom extensions—the best learning often comes from trial and error!
